On Thursday skies will be variably cloudy.
On Sunday it will be cloudy with sunny intervals.
The first day a guest, the third day a pest.
The tree is known by its fruit.
He's a novelist manque.
A stain clings to him.
He's hopeless.
Throw plenty of dirt and some will be sure to stick.
In every rumor there is a little bit of truth.
I'll go along with that.
It won't be my fault if things go wrong.
On what day?
Whom should I approach?

All lay load on a willing horse.
Hit or miss.
He's in her bad books.
Here's to you!
Here's to you!
Go in and win!
In reply to my question he said ...
We grant a trade of ... % on our list prices.
What page, please?
Tit for tat.
From your letter it would appear that ...
The letter doesn't indicate whether ...
Long absent, soon forgotten.
Out of sight, out of mind.

It's Lombard Street to a China orange.
You'll be in trouble for this.
I really blew it.
There you are!
There you are!
Here you are.
You've got me there.
That beats everything!
There you're mistaken.
You're very much mistaken there!
There is a trick to it.
That's the fly in the ointment!
There's not a jot of truth in it.
There is something shady about it.
I don't know anything about that.
That gives one a horse laugh.
That's the snag!
That's the fly in the ointment!
There's the rub.
That's the crux of the matter.
There's some mistake!
Then also the auto had to go and break down.
There must be some mistake.
There must be some mistake.
I had to swallow hard.
That's a horse of a different color.
That was the last straw.
I wouldn't say no to that.
You have another think coming if ...
There you are!
There you are at last.
You're playing with fire!
You're looking for a needle in a haystack.
That's the last straw!
There's more behind.
Heads will roll!
It cramps my style.
It gives me the creeps.
There are no objections to it.
That settles the matter once and for all.
That settles the matter.
It was a disaster.
That's over for good.
This won't serve my turn.
It's not worth a tinker's damn!
That cuts no ice with me.
It's nothing to write home about.
Nobody cares two hoots about it.
Thank you, the same to you!
Thank you for placing your order with us.
Thank you for your help.
Thank you for your understanding.
Thank you for having placed your trust in us.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Thank you very much!
Cheers!
Thank you very much!
Thank you for your time.
Thank you!
Thanks!
Then I got wise to him.
Well do it then if it pleases you.
There's a stigma attached to it.
It can't be helped.
You couldn't doubt it.
That will really give her food for thought.
It won't kill you.
That's a feather in his cap.
You can bet your life on it!
That's the bottom line of it.
It would never have occurred to me.
That implies ...
From this it follows that ...
It follows that ...
This shows that ...
This shows that ...
This indicates that ...
Thus it appears that ...
May I bring up the question of ...?
May I have your name?
Let me enlighten you.
May I take a look at it?
May I see him?
May I introduce Mr. Brown to you?
Can I give you a hand?
May I? - Please do!
May I join you?
May I talk to you privately?
May I trouble you for ...
May I bother you a moment?
May I introduce you to each other?
May I trouble you for a match?
May I have the next dance?
Could I just say in parenthesis that ...
May I introduce ...
That's not the issue.
There's no doubt about it.
There's no question about it.
That's dead and burried
I don't trouble my head about that.
That's debatable.
That's a matter of argument.
That's open to dispute.
The weather was bad and the mood was the same.
The irritating thing is that...
I enjoyed my supper.
Supply overtakes demand.
The car really copped it.
Better is the enemy of good.
the best one could possibly imagine
The picture is crooked.
The picture has turned out well.
The luck has turned.
The tide has turned.
That drives me nuts.
That's the pay-off.
That gets my goat.
The book embraces the fields of hunting and fishing.
The book sells well.
The book sells well.
The book is addressed to young readers.
The date slipped my mind.
My goose is cooked.
The worse is yet to come.
Mind you, keep warm!
That might well be so.
That's not urgent!
The only criticism
The upshot was that ...
That doesn't come up to scratch.
Dinner is served!
The food/meal lies heavy on my stomach.
The window has bars.
That clinched it for him.
That's none of your damn business!
That gets on my nerves.
It goes against the grain for me.
The money won't last.
Money just runs through his fingers.
The main problem is ...
That sucks
That sucks.
That's expecting a bit much
It's not so bad.
That's bad luck.
That's unbelievable!
That's awful!
That's horrible!
Life isn't all beer and skittles.
It's good to be alive.
The lease was prematurely terminated.
The museum will be opened on schedule.
That opens the flood gates to the demands of all the others.
The trouble is that ...
The project didn't get beyond the early stages.
The murder is out.
But the restaurant doesn't have a friendly
Fate treated him unkindly.
The ship was on schedule.
The ship is lying in the roads.
The worst is yet to come.
The game ended in a tie.
The game was a draw
The game is up.
The jig is up.
The flag is down.
The subject never came up.
The trial is still pending.
Little ripples spread out across the water.
The weather has scotched that.
The weather keeps up.
The weather is very close.
The weather looks promising.
The room faces north.
That's nothing to me.
That doesn't agree with me.
It offends my eye.
It all goes to prove that ...
That remains to be seen.
Let there be no more of this.
That takes just as long.
You must never forget that.
You're probably aware of it.
That is probably the best thing.
That ought to do.
This reminds me of home.
I'm really pleased.
That pleases me no end.
That will get you nowhere.
That will come to nothing.
That will lead to nothing.
This concerns you.
That doesn't regard you.
That's none of your business.
That's nothing to you.
That really takes it out of you.
It beggars description.
This is on me.
That's no concern of mine.
That's going too far.
That's going too far.
That's over my head.
That's too deep for me.
That's over my head.
This is yours.
That's beside the point.
That's just not done.
That's all part of my job.
This won't do.
That's quite enough.
That will do.
That serves him right.
That gives it that extra something.
This applies to ... also.
That applies to you, too.
And that goes for you too!
That isn't applicable to you.
This does not apply to you.
That was a close shave.
I quite believe it.
We seek good fortune, misfortune seeks us.
I thought as much!
This is of my own making.
That can wait till tomorrow.
There's a lot of sense in that.
He surely made that up out of thin air.
It has something to be said for it.
It worked like a charm.
It doesn't make sense.
There is no sense in that.
There's no point in that.
That has upset my plans.
That was a great help.
That doesn't mean anything.
It has just become a habit.
That was just her fancy.
We have been referred to you by ...
It spoiled our day.
That set a precedent .
That caused a great stir.
I surmised as much.
That doesn't mean a lot.
Charity begins at home.
It's a lot too thin!
That is connected with ...
That has to do with the fact that ...
I'm sick and tired of it.
This ought to have been done.
That was unnecessary!
You should have seen it!
That's a matter of opinion.
That's out of the question.
That is really too bad.
That's sheer madness.
Already done.
That's splitting hairs.
That's a minor matter.
It's nice, though.
That's all still up in the air.
That is nothing but hot air.
This is possible with him.
That's a solution of striking simplicity.
That's the bottom line.
That's mere child's play.
That just takes the biscuit!
That beats everything!
That's just about the limit.
That's all there is to it!
It's the real McCoy.
That's the limit.
That's the absolute truth.
That's old hat!
That takes the biscuit!
There is no comparison!
That's old hat!
It's no crime.
That really isn't possible.
That goes without saying!
It's not expecting too much of him.
That's more likely.
That's quite a comedown for him.
That's a tidy
What a sight!
It's a closed book.
That's another story.
It's a cinch.
That's a load of trash!
It's a completely different ball game.
It's a horse of a different colour.
That's a tall order.
That's mere child's play.
That's small comfort.
That's a bit thick.
That's pretty steep!
That's coming it strong.
It's no contest.
That is a sore point.
That is a sore point with him.
It's a raw deal.
That's a real grind.
That's nothing!
That's another story.
The question has to be put differently.
That's a dodgy situation.
That's a fine mess!
That's a pretty kettle of fish!
That's a pretty mess!
That's
That is inappropriate.
That's not bad.
That's
That's pretty tough!
There's a lot of sense in that.

That varies.
That isn't half bad.
That's six of one and half a dozen of another.
That's nuts to him.
That's quite possible.
She doesn't care a hang.
It's your funeral!
That's hanky-dory.
That's up in the air
That's an absolute scream!
Why, that's outragous!
You're being preposterous.
That really is the limit!
You must be kidding!
That's six of one and half a dozen of another.
There isn't much fear of it.
That's no piece of cake.
That's no comfort to me.
I'm serious about it.
That's my affair.
I know that.
I don't care.
It's all the same to me.
I've no preference.
That's news to me.
I don't give damn shit!
I don't give a fuck.
A fat lot I care!
That beats me.
That's too deep for me.
That is definitely right.
It's not worth the trouble.
That's not worth mentioning.
That's a bit fishy.
That's isn't aimed against you.
It's not everyone's cup of tea.
That's not my pigeon.
That's not my cup of tea.
It isn't my job.
That's not to our taste.
That's not half bad.
That's not bad.
That's not his strong point.
That can't be done.
That's not to be sneezed.
It's all in the day's work.
It's nothing to write home about.
There's more to it than that.
That's not definite yet.
That's only fair.
It's all in the mind.
That's anyone's guess.
This wants cleaning.
That's half the battle.
That's all very true, but ...
That's all over and done with.
That's true, of course.
It's very good of you.
That's his blind side.
That's an odd thing.
That is made up out of thin air.
That's as clear as mud.
That's strictly forbidden!
The scheduling is a real problem.
That's all my eye and Betty Martin.
That is our pride and joy.
That's beneath him.
That's of no importance.
That's a wine for you!
That will be all for the present.
That's really too much.
It's disgusting.
That is hardly possible.
It's much the same thing.
This has become something of an issue.
It's carrying things too far.
This may not be exactly nice, but it is useful.
You're not serious, are you?
It's a lot too thin!
Come, come. That won't hurt him.
This may have serious consequences.
I can give no such undertaking.
I can't possibly do this.
That's asking for trouble.
You're asking for trouble.
This cannot be compared

That sounds funny to me.
That's Greek to me.
That's out of the question.
Nobody could have foreseen
I couldn't tell you offhand.
Tell us another!
I'm glad of that!
I won't be talked into it!
That can be done.
That can be imagined.
That gives a deep insight.
That sounds reasonable.
That doesn't make sense to me.
That is because ...
It weighs heavily on my mind.
This isn't everybodys job.
It's not worth the effort
This is something like!
That's good to hear!
That can't be helped.
There's no denying.
That won't solve my case.
I can do it on my head.
It's no trouble at all!
I won't be a party to that.
That's asking for trouble.
That caused him a lot of trouble.
That makes no difference.
That's getting me down.
That worries me.
I get a kick out of it.
That makes it all the worse.
That doesn't matter.
This is making our lives a misery.
That's nothing to me!
That's fun!
That may be so.
That
You can't be serious!
That has still to be invented.
This calls for a celebration.
I must make a special note of that.
You have to get the boss to okay it.
That must be left up to her.
Give him his due.
You've got to hand it to him.
That calls for a drink.
You must take that into account too.
Fate would have it so.
That ought to be done by today.
That ought to do.
That's what I call smart.
That's no advantage to you!
That doesn't suit my plans.
You're just talking.
That won't hurt.
That does no harm.
It doesn't matter, you see.
That's outrageous.
That will wear off in time.
That covers everything.
That's just like you.
That's very unlike him.
It's all make believe.
That's no big deal.
That's a perfect fit.
It fits like a glove.
It was meant as a joke.
You should also take that into account.
That says something for him.
That speaks in his favour.
That speaks for itself.
That's a different kettle of fish.
That doesn't even enter the equation.
That's
This is not scheduled for this week.
That's not in keeping with his position.
That's beyond my power.
That is absolutely certain.
That's for sure!
The funniest part about it is ...
I wouldn't put it past him.
That isn't applicable to you.
One doesn't do that.
That's just
I am deeply distressed.
That cuts me to the quick.
I'm sorry about that.
I won't stand that.
I'll take a rain check on that.
That's self-evident.
That goes without saying.
It was
That really was
That was just what he is waiting for.
That was a great moment in her life.
That was decent of him.
That was not aimed at you.
Such was not my intention.
That was mad.
That's not much good.
That was a scream.
That was to be expected.
That was too funny for words.
Those were the days.
It's a wrap.
I would really appreciate that.
You'll hear of this!
Do you call that a man?
It's got to be done.
I intend to do just that.
I should say so!
I won't argue that point.
I don't like it one little bit.
That doesn't mean much.
That's saying a lot.
That will do
Tongues will wag.
I'm afraid it's not so easy.
That will be his undoing
We'll see about that.
Things will straighten out.
Everything will turn out all right.
That remains to be seen.
I dare say it's quite true.
But you know that!
What I had in mind ...
Wonder is the dearest child of faith.
That won't wash with me.
That cuts no ice.
Now, don't go and catch a cold!
Don't make me laugh!
You can't go by that.

No doubt he is a man-of-consequence, but ...
He has really taken leave of his senses.
He is absentminded.
He is clever, I grant, but ...
Though he's poor, he's an honest man.

He doesn't hold a grudge against him.
He bears no enmity.
He has been treading water.
He has been getting nowhere.
You'd think he couldn't say boo.

He's only pretending.

He simply doesn't count.
Do you remember me?
Does that name ring the bell?
All is permitted that pleases.
Deliver us from evil.
It was only when she rang up that I realized it.
Business before pleasure.
Before you run you must learn to walk.
I got to know about it only yesterday.
Only three days ago ...
To begin with he's too old.
Don't give me that story!
And did you ever see an oyster walk upstairs?
It means a lot to me.
She takes great delight in doing that.
She delights in doing that.
I'm relieved to hear that.
Things are looking up.
There's no room for hope.
I am concerned to hear that...
Nothing else remains to be done.
No opportunity offered itself.
It doesn't pay.
It's no use.
The train will be long in coming.
It is probably just a mistake.
There's no hurry.
It lacks substance.
He lacked the courage to do it.
It crossed my mind.
I had a job to do it.
It struck me right away.
We could think of nothing to say.
The question is whether this is true.
It's hard for me.
There was a spot of trouble.
There was a lot to do.
I like it very much.
I like it a lot.
It's all haywire.
Things are getting lively.
He's well off.
He's badly off.
He's hard up.
They are better off than we.
She is doing well.
It goes right through me.
I feel OK.
I've improved a lot.
It won't work.
There is nothing like travelling.
It's a matter of life and death.
It's neck or nothing.
His life is at stake.
Our main concern is that ...
What concerns us primarily is that ...
It's rather a question of whether ...
It's past comprehension.
It's beyond her grasp.
The end is not far off.
It's like Grand Central Station.
It's like Piccadilly Circus.
It's theirs.
It's mine.
It's bad manners.
He succeeded in overcoming the difficulties.
There is no escape.
There's still a lot to be done.
I suppose there are people who ...
I admit there are people who ...
It's pouring with rain.
It was either do or die.
It was a stormy affair.
Rain fell in sheets.
It was pelting down with rain.
There was a flash of lightning.
It will do tomorrow.
It serves no purpose.
I gained
It pelted with rain.
It's turning the world upside down.
Things are very tense.
There was a dead silence.
Everything hangs on your decision.
It depends largely upon you.
It's up to him.
It would be no good.
The rain passed off.
It's a matter of common knowledge.
It is about time!
It has not failed to leave its mark on her.
It's a done deal.
It's better to live rich, than to die rich.
You can please yourself about where you sit.
It's worth the trouble.
There's a fly in the ointment.
It is a mistake to assume that ...
It's such a shame!
It is absurd to ...
It is preposterous to ...
It's a red rag to him.
She's a delight to watch.
It's a mercy!
It was clearly his fault.
There's no doubt that it was his fault.
It's a beastly shame.
It was his own idea.
It's a delight to watch him.
It's a shame!
It's a lead-pipe cinch.
It's a busy street.
Something is going on.
Money can't buy it.
It is frightfully boring.
It is the custom.
It's about as broad as it's long.
These buildings are scheduled for demolition.
It's high time.
It just fell into his lap.
It's due to him.
It's always the same old story.
It's had it.
It is really ridiculous.
It's such a shame
There's no room left.
It's not worth a thing.
It's clear as daylight.
It's easy to be brave from a safe distance.
It's worth reading.
It is more or less a matter of taste.
It's my fault.
I mean it.
I loathe it.
I'm mortified.
It is a millstone around my neck.
I don't give a hoot one way or the other.
I can't understand it.
I'm in no laughing mood.
I don't give a damn.
I don't care a pap for it.
I's a moral certainty that...
All that glitters is not gold.
It is not worth the trouble.
It's not worth worrying about.
It isn't my job.
It's no wonder that ...
It's not a matter to laugh about.
No harm done.
It hasn't been decided yet.
There's plenty of room
That's the way things are.
It's merely a matter of form.
It's merely a matter of time.
It is only a stone's throw away.
It's only a stone's throw from here.
It's just an act.
It's
It is a pity. It's a pity.
It's horrible weather.
It's no end of trouble with him.
That's all right.
It's a great convenience.
It's a great pity.
It is thanks to him that ...
It's understood.
It's so quiet you could hear a pin drop.
It's pretty much the same.
It is a punishable offence ...
It's all up with her.
It is incontestable that ...
It's incredible.
It's the same wherever you go.
He put up a big front.
It may be too late.
It's perfectly silly.
It's far away.
It matters.
It really isn't very far.
It's a real shame with ...
I dare say it's only a matter of habit.
It's all over.
It's enough to drive you up the wall that ...
It is enough to put you to sleep.
It's enough to make you weep.
It's absolutely sickening.
There is no sense in that.
It's excellent value for money.
It occurred to me that ...
It occurred to me.
It never entered my head
It was like a bolt from the blue.
There's no harm in trying.
It rings true.
There's trouble in the air. There is trouble brewing.
Every little counts.
It seems to me that ...
It is out of the question.
There is also the fact that ...
My feet were tingling.
I had it on the tip of my tongue.
It was partly his doing.
It can not be denied.
It sends cold shivers up and down my spine.
The wording ran as follows.
It stands to reason.
It went like clockwork.
There are no reasons.
The results haven't come in yet.
It's up to him.
It lies with you to do it.
there is something in the wind.
It's not in him.
It's in her nature.
It runs in the blood.
It is in the nature of things.
It's in his interest.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
I don't care any more.
It means a lot to me.
That is important to me.
There's room for improvement.
It's worth the effort.
It's not worth it.
It's worth it.
It leaves me cold.
It allows of no excuse.
It can't be helped.
It boils all down to the fact that ...
It's been going on for three months now.
It beggars description.
Its existence cannot be argued away.
It's
It gives me the willies.
It's no trouble at all.
It makes no odds.
There's no harm if
There is a lack of ...
There was a lack of ...
Something must be done.
That remains to be seen.
It's no use.
It is not convenient for me.
It convenes with my plans.
I don't like it, but I will do it anyway.
It's raining cats and dogs.
It's pelting down.
It's sheeting down.
It is apt to rain in ...
It's raining hard.
The rain was coming down in sheets.
A good tale is none the worse for being told twice.
It looks that way.
It seemed never-ending.
It tastes of salt.
It looks like rain.
Things are shaping up well.
Things look rather bleak for him.
There are strings attached.
I should say it's about three years.
It won't happen again.
I intended it for a compliment.
It baffles description.
It beggars description.
It tells its own tale.
It was touch-and-go whether I passed my exams.
It's out of the question.
There is no mistaking what ought to be done.
You are at liberty to go.
You are free to go.
It's very becoming to you.
It's still in the balance.
It's still in the balance.
It's blowing a gale.
It all adds up.
It isn't much good.
There fell a deep silence.
It's hard on me.
He feels very bad about it.
I am sorry.
I am awfully sorry.
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm dreadfully sorry.
I'm really sorry.
It hurts like hell.
It is little surprise ...
It spread like wildfire.
Words fail me.
It was all a waste-of-time.
Darkness had come.
It was a put-up job.
It was a scene of destruction.
It was pathetic to see.
It was a fight to the finish.
It was a flop.
It was a costly affair.
It was a put-up affair.
It was a sheer delight.
Once upon in the time ...
It was a dog's breakfast.
It was a bit a peeve.
It was no picnic.
There was nothing more that could be done.
It was only a false alarm.
It was pure chance that ...
We had a lively time.
It was full to the bursting point.
I just can't understand it.
It's getting serious.
The story goes ...
Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you.
Nothing is as bad as it looks.
There is no explicit mention of it.
It won't last.
It won't last.
Things are never as bad as they seem.
That'll go off all right.
We'll have a fine day.
It will come out all right in the end.
I'm surprised.
The day turned out to be a fine one.
It was borne in on him.
It grew cold.
It peeved me that ...
I shouldn't be at all surprised if ...
I would be delighted to ...
It wouldn't harm you to be a little more polite.
It came to nothing.
There was a lot of laughter.
It got quite cold.
You had better go now.
There's some sense in doing that.
It wouldn't be a very good idea to ...
It would be pointless to ...
There is a draught. There is a draft.
Back up a little!
Slow down!
Make a left turn!
Passengers alight here.
Better come straight to the point.
Take a deep breath, wait for this!
If there are any problems
If you have any questions
In case it should rain ...
In case it rains ...
If undelivered, return to ...
Begin reading!
Make it short!
Be brief!
Wrong!
Is anything wrong with you?
Does that meet with your approval?
Fish and guests stink after three days.
Off you go!
Don't keep asking me.
Freedom is everywhere but I'm here.
Indeed!
Don't halloo till you're out of the wood!
I'm delighted to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm glad to see you again.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
Wet paint!
Well begun is half done.
Happy Easter!
Merry Christmas!
We used to live in the country.
Ability is the poor man's wealth.
Make yourself at home!
Feel at home!
Do you carry silk?
Are you telling me porkies?
Fill out this form, please!
I put my shirt on that man.
A cash discount of ... % is allowed for settlement within one month.
It's much too warm for this time of year.
I would give that man the shirt off my back.
A rapid response would be appreciated.
I have not time for him.
The woman he'll marry hasn't been born yet.
Bang goes the money.
Right off the bat.
Just as you please.
Just as you like.
Not half bad!
Not so dusty!
Pay heed to what he says!
Once bitten, twice shy.
Once burnt, twice shy.
Wait a minute, please!
A danger foreseen is half avoided.
Jump in the lake!
Deal with him kindly.
Walk inside!
Go along with him!
Go and have a wash!
Screw you!
Confound you.
Step aside!
Keep straight on.
Turn to
Use it sparingly!
Let's play it safe.
Let's go places!
Let us assume that...
Let's go to London!
Is tomorrow convenient?
Money doesn't bring happiness.
Money is tight.
A golden key can open any door.
Money will make the mare go.
Money is no consideration.
Money is no object.
Dirty trick!
Will this glass do you?
Open from 9 to 6.
I had to meet him of all people.
You're welcome!
A word and a blow.
No sooner said than done!
Serves him right!
Let's suppose that I'm right.
Might I ask a question?
Excuse me. Is this seat free?
Sure!
Let her rip!
Give him beans!
Are there any further questions?
Is there such a thing?
Is there such a thing?
Don't fuss so!
Don't brag so!
to fly off the handle
Glass - Fragile!
Don't run away with the idea.
Birds of a feather flock together.
I'm on my way!
God forbid!
God save the Queen!
Thank goodness!
Bully for you!
Great!
Great events are often foreshadowed.
Greetings!
Say hello to ... for me.
Give him my best
Give him my regards, although we haven't met!
Remember me to your father.
Well roared, lion!
You should chew your food properly.
Nice going!
A good lather is half the shave.
Get well soon!
See you better!
Good night!
Godspeed!
Have a nice trip!
Good evening!
Enjoy your meal!
Good morning!
Have a good New Year!
Good morning!
How do you do?
Howdy!
Enjoy!
Didn't I tell you before?
I'm right, am I not?
Do you have any comments to make?
Would you like to comment?
Do you have a light?
Do you have any money with you?
Do you feel hungry?
Have you any change?
Did you straighten out the matter?
Can you spare a minute?
Do you mind if I smoke?
Did you have a nice time?
Are you busy?
have dealt a hammer blow ...
Hi dude!
Hello everybody!
Hi!
Hello!
How are you?
Hi, folks!
Good luck!
Break a leg!
Mud in your eyes!
Steady on!
Shut up!
Hold your noise!
Hold your tongue!
Cling on tight!
Buck up!
Keep your strap shut!
Keep a stiff upper lip!
Keep me informed!
Stow it!
Please, save me a seat!
Keep it dark!
Keep to your right.
Hands up!
Hands off!
A trade in hand finds gold in every land.
You don't have to shout it from the housetops!
You're a lucky beggar!
Have you an idea where he could be?
Do you fancy a beer?
A lot you know
Did you ever!
Have you put on some water?
You've never done that!
Did you look at yourself in the glass?
Why didn't you tell me straightaway?
Was it worthwhile?
Does anyone have any further questions?
Did you ever see the likes of it?
Has she a temperature?
Hook it!
Skiddoo!
Heave ho!
Hey, buddy!
Spit it out!
Come in!
Much obliged!
Congratulations!
Don't keep crying!
I'm a bit under the weather today.
This is an off-day for me.
Everything's going wrong.
It's foul weather today.
This way, please.
This way in, please!
This is my business card.
We've come full circle.
This place is haunted.
It's his word against hers.
I'll agree to that.
That's all right
And that's all from me
Herewith we send you ...
Herewith we enclose ...
This is to inform you of ...
This is to certify ...
This is to notify that ...
Notice is hereby given that ...
... is herewith cancelled.
Hindsight is easier than foresight.
Yours respectfully
Yours sincerely
Yours truly
Pride comes before a fall.
Hopefully!
I hope it stays that way.
Curse him!
Get me the file.
Draw a deep breath!
Will you meet him at the train?
Oh oh!
Hundreds, nay thousands.
Hunger is the best relish.
Hunger is the best sauce.
Hooray!
Guard your tongue!
Be on your guard against him!
Cut it out!
Don't go on like that!
Stop talking!
Stop being silly!
Take my advice!
I say!
That sounds good.
So am I.
So did I.
Nor am I!
Nor I either.
I move we adjourn.
I thank you!
I beg to inform you ...
I'm afraid ...
It's within my grasp.
I fail to see what you mean.
I got goose pimples
I have it sent to me.
It escaped my notice.
I envy your calm.
I have no regrets
I decided to keep him at arm's length.
I haven't a penny to my name.
I am an American
I am an American
I've just entered the job market.
It is my turn.
I beg to differ.
I bombed out with her.
I'm out of favor with her.
I'm in his good books
I'm in favour of going.
I'm curious about it.
I don't feel happy about it.
I quite agree.
I'm short of cash this month.
I'm not that stupid!
It's my turn.
I'm sort of glad.
I'm running a bit late.
I nearly fell over backwards.
I'm firmly
I'm ready.
I am quite ready.
I am all set.
I am all run down.
I'm a stranger here.
I've arranged to meet her tomorrow.
I'm quite put out about the matter.
I'm all mixed up.
I feel tired out.
I really put my foot in it!
I escaped by the skin of my teeth.
I'm of good cheer.
I'm a stranger here.
I've my back to the wall.
I am ill.
I'm snowed under with work.
I am at my wit's end.
I give up!
I'm at my wits' end.
I don't feel up to the mark.
I'm not qualified to speak for him.
I'm not sure.
I'm afraid, I don't agree.
I've never ever been so insulted.
I was not born yesterday.
I'm broke.
I agree in principle.
I am full
I'm full up.
I'm badly off.
I have suffered from heavy losses.
I'm very much in favour of it.
I've been here for five days.
I don't know what to say.
Your behaviour appalls me!
I'm convinced that ...
My mind is not at ease.
I am totally exhausted.
I'm tired from work.
My time is fully engaged.
I am, it is true, his father ...
I'm double your age.
It's me.
I gritted my teeth and said nothing.
May I have the floor.
I stick to it.
I'm not staying here any longer!
I need to get some exercise.
I'll see you home.
I meant no harm by it.
I kind of thought.
I was first exposed ...
Thank you very much indeed.
I also mustn't forget ...
I must not.
I dare say ...
I think, therefore I am.
I think the same
I've a notion that ...
I don't think so.
I wouldn't dream of it.
I think so.
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.
I'm mortified.
I surrender!
I beg to differ.
I loathed having to tell him.
I don't see the fun of it.
It seems to me eminently reasonable.
I'm at a loss for words.
I'm unable to appreciate modern music.
I'll eat my hat if ...
I am glad.
I look forward hearing from you soon.
I'm glad to meet you.
I'm pleased to be able to tell you ...
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.
I'm cold.
I was ill at ease.
I felt very uncomfortable.
I feel like a fifth wheel.
I showed him into the room.
I am afraid that ...
I was afraid he would put his foot in it.
I'm willing to admit that ...
I'll hedge my bet.
I go to the pictures.
I'm off.
I'm going along.
I go home.
I go for a swim.
I stand to win.
I went shopping.
I rather think ...
I don't believe a word of it.
I believe I can afford to let it go.
I think he's out of the wood now.
I think it will rain.
I think I've been had.
I think I've been done.
I think I've broken my ankle.
Well, I'll be damned.
I think we'll have good weather.
I seized the opportunity with both hands.
I just managed it.
I've got it.
I knew it!
I've got it down pat.
Gotcha!
I need some rest badly.
I was in luck!
I didn't quite catch what you said.
I've other fish to fry.
I have no independent opinion on the subject.
I feel a sensation of being watched.
I didn't catch the word.
I missed the connection.
I didn't catch the sentence.
I failed the test.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Gotcha
I've been looking all over for you.
I have found that ...
I let the cat out of the bag.
I didn't catch your last words.
I'm fed up with strikes.
I don't have pots of money.
I've got a big fav
I have a memory like a sieve.
I have a bone to pick with you.
I have a dodgy leg.
I've got a raise at work.
I have got an idea.
I've a bad cold.
I'm mad about ...
I was properly scared and no mistake!
I have a hangover.
I have a day off.
I had heard nothing of it until ten minutes ago.
I have read only ten pages so far.
I have it from a good source.
I told you, didn't I!
I just managed it.
I heard it this morning on the radio.
I told you so.
I arranged it in advance.
I don't have it with me.
I only said it in fun.
I'm fed up with it.
I'm sick of it.
I'm tired of it.
I've known it to happen.
I forgot about it.
I knew it would happen.
I could see it coming.
I*ve rather got the impression ...
I don't fancy the idea, but I'll have to do it.
I've nothing on tonight.
I have paved the way for him.
I told him where to get off.
I drummed it into him that ...
I landed him one in the face.
I've got his number.
I asked his advice.
I happened to meet him.
I've always fought shy of claiming that...
I'm not a bit hungry.
I didn't get a wink of sleep.
I haven't any money.
I have no small change.
I haven't a clue!
I haven't the faintest idea.
I don't feel like doing ...
I don't want to ...
I'll be damned if I know!
I'm on shore leave.
I have a mind to ...
I've enough and to spare.
I have a room of my own.
I can't take any more.
I've changed my mind.
I was bored stiff.
I've an upset stomach.
I've burnt my fingers.
I've had a very bad experience of ...
I was quite disconcerted to realize ...
I have not the faintest idea.
I haven't the remotest idea.
It is none of my doing.
I can't fault it.
I can't see anything wrong with it.
I have no objections.
I don't mind being pen-friends.
I have no grievances against him personally.
I was only listening with half an ear.
I'm feeling blue.
I have taken her to my heart.
I've never seen her.
I have nothing at all to wear.
I'm up to my ears with work.
I feel it is appropriate ...
I played my trump card.
I was completely browned off.
I had expected better of it.
I'll thump you if you ...
I'll belt you one!
I fancy the idea of doing ...
I have half a mind to ...
I could have cried.
My name is Frank.
I hope so.
I hope you'll be with us for a long time yet.
I hope you'll back my plan.
I'll call for you this evening.
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.
I chanced to hear it.
I'm interested in ...
I can make nothing of it.
I can do that standing on my head.
I can do that with both hands tied.
I'm afraid I couldn't go along with that.
I can't get the knack of it.
I know German.
I can't bear this heat.
I can't perform miracles!
I can tell you a thing or two about it.
I can do it by myself.
I can ill afford it.
I can't afford it.
I can't get at it.
I can't help doing it.
I can't do it.
I can't stand it any longer.
I can take it.
I can't bear to look.
I cannot bear him.
I can't bear him.
I can't refuse her anything.
That's not my fault.
I can't make any promises.
Of course
I can't work up any enthusiasm for it.
It just doesn't appeal to me
I can't complain.
I can't afford a car.
I can't help it.
I can't pluck up my courage.
I can't make head or tail of it.
I cannot make head or tail of it.
I cannot keep up.
I can't walk any further.
I can't help it.
I'm really not responsible for it.
I can't go on any longer.
I can't get a word in edgewise.
I can't do anything with it.
I hardly knew her.
I know him by name.
I know him by sight.
How well I know them!
I stick on the stamp.
I'll just drop in for a second.
I'll come and pick you up.
I can manage with less.
I'll arrive a week tomorrow.
I couldn't help laughing.
I smiled despite myself.
I couldn't get a word in edge-wise.
I laugh myself to death.
I was terribly bored.
Who do they take me for?
Who do they think I am?
I don't like being ordered about.
I'll run you a bath.
I won't support him any longer.
Remember me to him
Don't take me for an idiot.
I am not getting involved in this!
I refuse to be rushed.
I'll not be browbeaten.
I don't like being stereotyped.
I'll give them a run for their money.
I won't let it get me down.
I'm not losing any sleep over that.
I'm having a house built.
I love to read.
I am fond of reading.
I had it done.
I love you.
I had her sit down.
I call it a day.
I'll do it this minute.
I don't care a fig for it.
I kinda like that.
I'm serious about it.
I should like to ...
I should like to ...
I would rather ...
I've half a mind to run off.
I want to come clean with you.
I have no desire to cause you any trouble.
I want to tell you the truth.
I want to run my own life.
I wish to thank you for ...
I don't want to be committed.
I wouldn't like to be in his shoes.
I have to admit though that ...
I've got to watch what I eat.
I've got to go to the loo.
I'm dying to go to the loo.
I have to do an errand.
I must start by saying the following.
I have to go.
I must tell you about it to get it off my chest.
I must always sort things out.
I must have my wits about me.
I must go to the bathroom.
I have to start bright and early.
I'm bound to say ...
I'm surprised at you!
I must put up with much.
I couldn't help laughing.
I had to be very persuasive.
I had to swallow a lot.
It made me cry.
I wonder who he is.
I want to read in peace.
I don't want that much.
I only want a little bit.
I only want a small piece.
I take it that ...
I take that at face value.
I'll take you up on that.
I suppose so.
I'm not going to mince matters.
I couldn't care less.
I couldn't care less about it.
I'm bursting with curiosity.
I'm off the booze.
I won't lift a finger.
I'll give you the low down.
It was brought home to me.
I felt impelled to say it.
I was on pins and needles.
I just managed it.
I sleep like a log.
I slept like a top.
I killed two birds with one stone.
I am writing to ...
I see it in my mind's eye.
I fail to see ...
I put all my eggs in one basket.
I assume that these facts are known.
I carried my point.
I've been asked to tell you that...
I'm to go tomorrow.
I ought to go.
I only speak a little German
I'm on his side.
I prefer standing.
I'm on good terms with him.
I put my watch an hour ahead.
I'm starving
I called at your house.
I'm in the dark.
I did it at his suggestion.
I told him what was most important.
I happened to meet him.
I chanced to meet her.
I don't like the look of it.
I daren't go home, I'm scared to go home.
There's something in the wind.
It's too good to last.
I don't trust him an inch.
I put
I couldn't believe my ears
I'll do it this minute.
Language, Sir!
I owe him much.
I earn more money now.
I'm getting stale.
I can't cope
I can't take it any longer.
I insist on obedience.
I count on you.
I see!
I don't understand the question.
Very likely I fail to understand myself.
I don't understand ...
I can't figure
It's as clear as mud.
It's all Greek to me.
I get it.
I'm trying to fathom what ...
I trust him.
I was apt to believe him until ...
I've been extremely busy lately.
I was truly grateful.
I would be grateful if you could
I'd be much obliged.
I'm waiting to hear your explanation.
I should prefer to wait until evening.
I should prefer to wait.
I wash my hands.
I wash my hands of it.
I know about it.
I'm blessed if I know.
I'm sure I don't know.
I appreciate the fact that ...
I defy you to do it.
I don't know a thing about it.
I'm at a loss what to do.
I don't know whether I'm coming or going.
I don't know anything about it.
I know my own mind.
I know where the shoe pinches.
I am perfectly aware of the fact that ...
I will take care of everything else.
You're not making sense.
I can't figure it out.
I will call a spade a spade.
I'll give you what for!
I'll spread the news to everyone.
I'll be happy to convey the message.
I'll think it over.
I'll never make it.
I'll do it, I assure you.
I'll keep my fingers crossed.
I'll teach him a lesson he won't forget.
I'll give him what for!
I'll tell him where to get off with that stuff.
I'll pay him all right.
I will inform you.
I won't trouble you with the details.
I'll see you further first.
I'll act on your advice.
I'll act on your advice.
I'll do my level best.
I'm going to give vent to my feelings.
I will take good care not to do that.
No fear!
I'll see to it at once.
I'll make do with it.
I will make ends meet.
I will talk her into it.
I can't figure her out at all.
I don't want to say anything about that.
I'll have a whack at it.
I won't take advantage of you.
I won't hear of it.
I mean to say ...
Don't let me keep you.
I was just about to leave.
I got soaked to the skin.
I was delayed by the rain.
I was cordially received.
I became familiar with him.
I wish he would come.
I wish I could stay.
A penny for your thoughts.
I'd rather not go.
I would rather wait.
I would go even further.
I'm dying to know ...
I paid him out in his own coin.
I for one.
I'm in doubt about it.
I'm annoyed about it.
He has two teeth missing.
He needs a little horse sense.
He lacks the courage to do it.
He is shy of money.
He was completely lacking in courage.
He saw daylight.
All things are alike to him.
He blew a fuse.
He's peeved.
He's beyond help.
His courage fell.
He's a real teaser.
He's up to his neck in it.
He got bitten by the bug.
He cringed at the thought.
He's feeling his oats.
She feels sick.
Her name escapes me.
Her new hat becomes her.
Her eyes were filled with tears.
Your chances are small.
Your help is beyond price.
Your help is greatly appreciated.
Your plan doesn't make any sense at all.
I don't see your conclusion.
Ther was an edge to her voice.
We are full up for December.
No kidding!
I got cold feet at the last moment and didn't do it.
The price is all-inclusive.
The program will include several breaks.
Within the framework of the proposed urban-planning development ...
As things developed the following tendency became apparent.
Just follow your nose!
Hold your horses!
Take it easy!
You always have to have something to gripe about.
There used to be ghosts in this house.
There was a mix-up in the line-up.
All is fair in love and war.
Keep it simple, stupid.
Beggars can't be choosers.
The devil dances in an empty pocket.
A should be used in preference to B in some cases.
With tender and loving care she follows him.
In what connection?
What line are you in?
Owing to the rain we couldn't come.
Looking at me she said ...
No smoke without a fire.
You can't have everything.
We all make mistakes.
To err is human.
Errors excepted!
Is anybody there?
Are you in earnest?
When the cat's away, the mice do play.
Is this method patented?
Is this seat reserved?
Is this seat taken?
Is something bugging you?
Is he a glutton for work?
Can you walk on it?
Is it fact or fable?
Is it all right with you?
Is there enough wine to go round?
Is anyone sitting here?
Does this mean anything to you?
Kinky!
Is there anybody around?.
Is there any juice left?
Is there any tea left?
It is her?
Is there any mail for me?
Well, actually ...
Come now, that's different.
Well, that's an old story.
Yes, of course!
Yes, for sure!
Oh, by the way.
The sooner the better.
Depending on how late we arrive ...
Man forges his own destiny.
We all make mistakes.
We all make mistakes.
Everyone has to learn by experience.
Everyone knows best where the shoe pinches.
Let's go Dutch.
jejunum
Somebody likes you.
Jeepers!
Sharp's the word!
Now I'm back to normal.
Now I'm finally putting the finishing touches to it.
Now more than ever.
It's now or never.
Now I begin to see.
Now I get it.
It's all or nothing now.
It's do or die now.
That's torn it!
His number is up.
Come off it!
Now stay put!
I've got to leave now.
Now you're talking sense.
That's the last straw!
This is the limit!
The ball's in your court.
Now you're making sense.
You've got me there! I have no answer.
It all makes sense now.
The band begins to play.
Boy, oh boy!
Boys will be boys.
May I have a word with you?
Can it be true?
Can you put some cream on my back, please?
No savvy!
Savvy?
Not for drinking!
No idea!
Don't
Don't worry, it's no hassle!
No funny business!
No fear!
Don't split hairs!
No ceremony!
Don't argue!
There is no such thing as a must.
Don't get panicky!
None of your lip!
You're welcome!
Don't mention it.
Wild horses couldn't drag me there.
There's none so blind as those who will not see.
No way!
Children not admitted!
Children and fools speak the truth.
Fine feathers make fine birds.
Clothes make the man.
Many a mickle macks a muckle.
A creaking door hangs longest.
Strange, isn't it?
Better come straight to the point.
Do come!
Don't fail to come!
Come into the garden.
Don't darken my door again.
Come along!
You should come see us once in a while!
Do come in!
Get home safe!
Be sure to come on time!
None of your excuses!
See me tomorrow!
Don't run with the idea that ...
Let's dispense with the preliminaries.
Let's get down to brass tacks!
Can you manage it okay?
Time will tell.
We cross that bridge when we come to it.
I was wondering if you could ...
Can you put me up?
Bear up!
Buck up!
Cheer up!
Chin up!
Mind your head!
Scratch a lover, and find a foe.
Are these bits scrap?
Can you swear to that?
Can you keep the things rolling while I'm away?
Can you be more precise?
Can you specify what you mean?
Could you please speak louder
Could you please help me?
Could you tell me where the station is?
Could you possibly ... ?
Keep in cool place!
Never mind him.
Don't cross your bridges before you come to them!
Don't bother about it!
Mind your own business!
Mind your own business!
Long time no see.
The longer the speech, the less thought.
Drive slowly!
Slow down!
Drop it!
Better not do that!
Keep your hands off!
Don't be down in the mouth!
Stop it! Cut it out!
Don't let me keep you.
Don't lose heart!
Mind you don't get caught!
Keep your tail up!
Don't be fooled by him.
Don't do anything desperate!
Don't let on anything!
Don't bother!
Take it from me.
Forget it!
Leave me alone!
Get off my case!
Stop hassling me!
Don't bother me!
Stop joking!
Don't be down in the mouth.
Drop me at the corner.
Don't let me disturb you!
Don't get discouraged.
Don't let yourself be fooled.
Let's drop the subject.
Let's drop the whole thing.
Don't push your luck!
Just let me have a look.
Don't let me down!
Don't leave me in the lurch!
Don't keep me in suspense.
Don't keep me on tenterhooks.
Keep at it!
Let's clear the air and make a fresh start.
Say it with flowers.
Run for it!
Live fast, love hard, die young.
Good bye!
Farewell!
Life is what happens to you while you are making plans.
Where do you live?
Lick me on the ass!
Kiss my ass!
Eat my shorts!
Bugger it!
Get stuffed!
Put something by for a rainy day!
Read it off!
Unfortunately
I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry to say ...
I'm afraid we have to go now.
I'm afraid not!
Worse luck!
The eyes of love are blind.
Love is blind.
Love and understanding are seldom found together.
Dear ...
My dear ...
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Better death than dishonor.
Linux rules!
Quick, let's beat it!
Come on, let's go.
Go on! It's a dare!
Don't lie to me!
A lie has no feet.
Lies have short legs.
Lies don't travel far.
Never do that again!
Get ready at once!
Don't blame yourself!
Never mind.
Make it snappy!
Grin and bear it!
Give them hell!
Don't fuss!
Quit joking!
Keep out of mischief!
Pull your finger out!
Keep your shirt on!
Leave me alone!
Don't make such a fuss.
Buck up!
Look lively!
Draw it mild!
Do your worst!
Take it or leave it!
Make three copies!
Make yourself at home!
Make yourself comfortable!
Don't inconvenience yourself!
Don't trouble yourself on my account.
Don't let it trouble you!
Don't worry!
Don't go to any trouble!
Have it your own way!
Are you on?
Might is right.
Never mind!
Let everyone do it who can.
Come what may.
Could be!
May she be ever so beautiful.
Speak of the devil and the devil shows up!
Don't meet trouble halfway!
In this connection it shouldn't be forgotten that ...
It was learned yesterday.
Give a dog a bad name and hang him.
You've been had.
You can't please everybody.
It's safe to say.
It's safe to say ...
The leopard cannot change his spots.
You never can tell.
It's as clear as daylight that ...
It's cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey.
He is not to be relied upon.
There is no mistaking her.
It's within walking distance.
They could not prove anything against her.
Don't be deceived.
You would think that ...
It is necessary to boil the water.
Don't buy a pig in a poke.
Now that's going too far.
You've got to hand it to him.
It's got to be pounded into you.
One has to take a hard line with him.
A bit of what you fancy does you good.
Can't complain.
You can't see your hand in front of your face.
She doesn't look her age.
One should strike while the iron's hot.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Aren't we even allowed to talk?
One should look only on the good side of people.
One would imagine.
We are promised higher wages.
You never know.
Man overboard!
gripes
Don't be so fussy!
More than enough is too much.
My car is a real clunker.
My impressions were very mixed.
My heart beats fast.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
I haven't got a clue.
I haven't the faintest idea.
My sight is very poor.
My feet were numb with cold.
My pain has gone.
My turn will come.
Are you not also of the opinion that ...
I don't mind!
For all I care!
For my sake!
Man alive!
Human blood is all one color.
Mark my words!
I really copped it.
My head is trobbing.
My head is spinning.
My head is spinning.
My hair is falling out.
Words fail me.
It took a load off my mind.
I like the way he works.
I am OK.
I heard it through the grapevine.
I'm under notice to leave.
I am cold.
I couldn't fail to notice that ...
I heard it through the grapevine.
My head swims.
For me she's too frivolous.
I feel ill.
I am warm.
It's all right with me.
My blood was up.
My head is spinning.
My patience is wearing thin.
My heart was in my mouth.
My hands are tied.
My hair stood on end.
My hair stood on end.
With the compliments of the season
With stupidity the gods themselves struggle in vain.
How can you get anything done with people like that?
He is not a person to be trifled with.
I've finished with you.
His speech won over all the critics.
Who is your date?
Who's his date?
Does it have to be today
Need he do it?
Don't run him so down!
Would you care for a cup of coffee?
Would you like a lift?
May your days be full of joy.
Let people say what they wish.
The early bird catches the worm.
Idleness is the beginning of all vice.
The devil finds work for idle hands.
Come on, folks!
Yeah?
Well, so what!
All colors will agree in the dark.
After the crack-up a close-up was taken.
After you.
Oops!
Fancy meeting you here!
Let us assume ...
Take either road.
Don't take it amiss.
Take your time.
Fancy that!
Well, I never!
No! By no means!
For the last time, no!
A new broom sweeps clean.
Don't! Stop it!
Not a scrap!
Don't push!
Not just yet!
No looking! No peeping!
You don't say so!
Not for the life of me!
Fancy him doing that!
No lagging!
Not that I know of.
Not that I remember.
None but fools!
No you don't!
No harm meant!
No offence!
His halo never slips.
You're welcome!
Don't mention it!
Nothing doing!
Delete as applicable.
No person other than yourself.
Let no-one say that...
Take the lot!
Be yourself!
Get a grip!
Pull yourself together!
Take him at his word!
Anything else?
Down but not out.
Any more fares?
Again, thank you for ...
When poverty comes in, love flies out.
Necessity knows no law.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
Take this down please ...
no.
well
Now finally he's got the hang of it.
Now less then ever!
What am I going to do now?
Now I need some good advice.
Come off it!
Now I certainly won't!
Wait and see!
Only nobodies are modest.
I don't fancy that!
Anything but that!
Don't be shy!
Don't be in such a hurry.
Never say die!
Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches.
More power to you!
Make the most of it!
I wonder if he still knows me.
Answer the door please!
Good gracious!
That's too bad!
No cross, no crown.
No sweet without sweat.
There is no pleasure without pain.
No liability assumed!
No ticky, no washy.
I'm not taking any!
It was a perfectly organized disaster
A tidy house, a tidy mind.
Cads' fighting when ended is soon mended.
Paper doesn't blush.
No parking.
Look out!
Mind the baby!
Is tomorrow convenient to you?
Take good care of yourselves.
Be careful!
Look out!
Pay close attention!
Bang!
Fie!
Ugh! Disgusting!
The train is scheduled at 11 o'clock
Move along, please!
Out of memory.
Present arms!
Prices are subject to change without notice.
Suck it and see.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
Have a go!
Happy New Year!
Here's Mud in Your Eye!
Hist!
Give your shoes a shine!
Keep off the grass!
No smoking!
You can count me out!
Don't talk rubbish! Stop talking rubbish!
Don't talk so loud!
Don't beat around the bush!
A shut mouth catches no flies.
Talk is silver, silence is golden.
Sale goods cannot be exchanged.
Don't get aggravated!
Pull yourself together!
Rome wasn't built in a day either.
Give me a call!
Peace is the citizen's first obligation.
Keep your hair on!
Get lost!
Nuts to you!
Gently!
Steady!
Tell him to go!
Why don't you go and tell him?
Tell him to pick us up.
Tell her in a roundabout way that ...
Kindly tell me ...
Checkmate!
Check!
Bummer!
Can you manage it?
Turn on the light!
Don't look like that!
Let's get it over with!
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Fuck!
Go to hell!
Kidding aside.
Joking aside.
Don't put the blame on me!
Don't lay the blame on me!
Fire away!
Get cracking!
Put it there! Agreed!
Stop beating around the bush!
There's an end of it!
Key found, claim from ...
Well, that's settled!
That's OK.
Never mind.
As early as the autumn of 1989 ...
She's already deep in debt to him.
Give my regards to the folks.
Write the word out in full!
Get it into your thick head that ...
Drop me a line!
Cobbler, stick to your trade.
A cobbler should stick to his last.
Forget it!
Shame on you!
Be ashamed of yourself!
Have you no self-respect?
Fasten your seat belt for your own safety!
Have a nice evening!
Beauty is power, a smile is its sword.
Put your name here.
Are you on for dinner tonight?
Dear Ms. ...
Dear Mr. ...
Dear Sir or Madam
Dear Sirs
To Whom It May Concern
I'd be glad to!
Be a good girl
Be good!
Keep your powder dry!
Now, be patient!
Be quiet, will you!
Be a sport.
Cheer up!
Don't be a poor sport!
Don't be a sorehead!
Don't make a noise!
Don't be cross with me.
Don't be so immature!
Keep quiet!
Be a darling and ...
Keep quiet!
Anyway!
Behave yourself!
Be frank with me!
Stick to facts.
Don't be angry with me but ...
Don't be mad at me!
Let's face it.
His report caused a sensation.
There's no limit to his ambition.
His friend helped him out.
His salary was cut.
You ought to have seen his face.
His face was a perfect study.
His life is hanging by a thread.
His life is completely taken up by work.
His spirit broke.
His name escaped me.
His reputation is tarnished.
His reputation is tarnished.
I don't like his suggestion at all.
His plans went up in smoke.
He is scheduled to speak tomorrow.
His days are numbered.
His dreams came true.
His time is up.
From that time on things really only got worse.
When was the last time you saw her?
How long since?
Blaming oneself never helps.
Please don't put ideas into his head.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Never venture all in one bottom.
I'm sure he will come.
She had a ripping good time.
You jest, sir!
They attend the meeting.
She was a vision of delight.
They defied him.
She drove me crazy.
They carried the enterprise through.
You needn't justify yourself.
She hasn't got to go.
She laid the table.
She's cracking up.
She won't have any argument.
She wasn't allowed to go.
You must not go there.
They're taking their time about it.
She lightened her heart.
She unburdened her mind.
They took a fancy to each other.
She flung her arms around his neck.
She fell on his neck.
They want the government to back out of the nuclear energy program.
They asked me point-black.
They asked me point-blank.
She passed her hand over her forehead.
She feels hurt.
They're only giving us the run around.
She said yes.
She tried hard.
She gave herself up to him.
It's your deal.
They're going together.
They went wild
They went besides themselves.
She didn't fall for your line.
She went over her notes.
They were on their way home.
They sold like hotcakes.
She doesn't begrudge it to you.
She doesn't begruge it to you.
They won by three goals to one.
They've got what it takes.
They have one child and that happens to be a son.
You've a day off.
You've asked for it.
It's all very well for you to laugh!
Talk is cheap.
You don't stand a chance.
You haven't an earthly.
There's no love lost between them.
They feel empty.
You're right.
You're quite right, but ...
They didn't get on well together.
They put up a good fight
We've missed you badly.
She has a crush on him.
She has a 38-inch bust.
She made it up.
She's got the situation taped.
She's very well endowed!
She's crazy about television.
She took it the wrong way.
She has all the answers.
She said never a word.
She has no feeling for art.
She turned him down.
She pulled his leg.
She made him ridiculous.
She really has her husband under her thumb.
She has a slight headache.
She's a nobody.
She has not a rag to put on.
After much hesitation, she has finally made up her mind.
She got very annoyed.
She takes after her mother.
She doesn't know the first thing.
She always had an excuse ready.
She had pity on him.
She had no money on her.
She had left herself out on a limb.
She fancies him as her husband.
She listened in silence.
I'm afraid you're wrong.
She is anything but pretty.
I can' imagine our team without her.
She's head over heels in love.
She's some woman.
She's a glutton for books.
She's an early bird.
She's a dumb Dora
She's bent on going.
She has no imagination.
She's of French stock!
She's in his good books.
She has a cold today.
She is going steady.
She has a steady boyfriend.
She's in a fever of excitement.
I like her.
She's not in.
There's no pleasing her.
She's dressed up to the nines.
She's quick at repartee.
She's weak in French.
She's grown very thin.
She's very particular.
She's all the world to him.
She's the limit.
She is out of town.
She's quite a back number.
She's herself again.
She's back home.
She's rather a clever person.
She ran him out of the house.
She came last.
Then she did come after all?
She dropped in.
She regained consciousness.
She arrived by bus.
She came up from the country.
She has the common touch.
She's good at sums.
She can twist him around her little finger.
She doesn't know her meter and bounds.
You'll come, won't you?
She couldn't hide her emotion.
You can bet your bottom dollar.
You might as well ...
You can buy the lease for a period of 20 years.
You may as well own up.
They couldn't guarantee anything.
I'll see you further first.
You can take it from me.
You can count on that.
You're wasting your breath.
She is a kept women.
They live from hand to mouth.
She flatly denied.
They love one another.
They are always at loggerheads.
She let him fuck her.
They sent him to Coventry
They didn't need to be told twice.
They invited friend and foe.
She gives her fancy full scope.
She's a lying so-and-so.
You've no idea!
She gives me a lot of trouble.
She's only trying to poke fun at you.
She looked surprised.
She is serious about him.
She means business.
She must always play the gallery and be the center of interest.
She had to swallow a lot.
She's fishing for compliments.
You have to show your colours.
You must give him encouragement.
You must handle him with kid gloves.
You should know ...
You have to make up your mind.
You must apologize.
They made themselve scarce.
They took to their heels.
She decided to give him a wide berth.
They are pulling my leg.
She nodded her head.
They're a bad match.
She's bursting with curiosity.
She swept from the room.
She speaks in images.
They keep on talking about the same old stuff.
Her eyes rolled.
She looks down her nose at people.
You don't mean it, do you?
She was at the wheel.
They have it pretty cushy
She presented him with a son.
They are playing a trick on me.
She confined herself to her room.
She soft-soaped him.
She cut him dead. She ignored him.
She paved up and down.
She poured her heart out to me.
They are playing hooky.
They're rolling in money.
You look well.
You can't see any further than the end of your nose.
She looks as if butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.
She has good vision.
They're quite close in age.
It's your turn.
They're respectable people.
They are tuned to the same wavelength. They understand each other.
It's your turn!
They are bosom buddies.
This means you.
They are on a par.
They are as different as day and night.
They are about the same size.
They disappeared into thin air.
They fight like cat and dog.
She's in a jam.
She is alleged to have said that...
She's supposed to be very intelligent.
Don't put the cart before the horse.
You had better go.
I'll give you what for!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
They are playing a trick on me.
She is in a huff.
They got up at an unearthly hour.
They're in cahoots together.
She's full of good ideas.
She is frightened to death.
I get good vibes from her.
They are playing a trick on me.
I'm sorry for her.
They claimed their money back.
You're flogging a dead horse.
They sympathize with him.
She was well-liked by her peers.
She was offended.
She had a hair-do yesterday.
She had the sense to ...
She was fast asleep.
They were beside themselves with joy.
She can't manage alone.
You'll soon get well.
You are requested to ...
I'm sure you'll understand me.
They will have to learn to do without.
She's a bad sailor.
She won't. She will not.
You must surely know that ...
She's staying with me.
She lives one floor below me.
Are you asking for trouble?
She refused to believe it.
What can I do for you?
They got to be friends.
They were caught red-handed.
You have been mentioned to us as ...
She was very outspoken about it.
She gave me the cold shoulder.
Look ahead!
Do you ever see him?
You see!
Are there any more questions?
Are you in favour? - No, I'm anti.
Are you full?
Yeah?
Those are my sentinemnts.
I know better.
Queen Anne is dead!
Such a coward!
What a lot
The very idea!
What a frost!
Confound his impudence!
What a shame!
What a bummer!
Such a thing doesn't exist.
I never heard such a thing!
Stop pumping me!
Same here!
Much as I would like.
Those were his exact words.
Do listen!
Such is life!
It was bound to happen.
That's much too sweeping a statement.
However rich he may be ...
That's what you think!
We are not that quick on the trigger.
That's what you think!
Upon my Sam!
Upon my life!
So help me God!
That's the way he wants it.
As soon as
The instant I saw her ...
This kind of activity suits me.
Do you call that a joke?
Are you joking?
Shall I wrap it for you?
Anything else?
As far as I know ...
For all I know ...
For aught I know ...
To my knowledge ...
I like that!
So far as I recall ...
As far as I can remember ...
To the best of my recollection ...
To the best of my remembrance ...
Save it!
All jokes aside!
He's late, but he's coming after all.
I've got your number!
Do you play the piano?
Don't try and fool me!
Let's play for keeps.
Don't talk with your mouth full!
Spit it out!
Don't you forget it!
Put it in your pocket!
Maximize your effectiveness!
Turn off the radio!
Just fancy, ...
Little strokes fell big oaks.
Anything to oblige!
Hush!
Will it trouble you if I smoke?
Road closed!
Try hard!
Pull yourself together!
Make no mistake about it ...!
Knock on wood!
It's a go! Settled!
Wow!
Sure!
You go, girl!
Tears were rolling down her cheeks.
I dare you!
Do you do any sport?
So long!
Please don't do it!
For goodness' sakes, don't do it!
Do it for my sake.
Do it yourself.
Do it without delay.
Do me a favour.
Do it with a clear conscience.
Do as you please.
Leave it to me!
Let's put it to an impartial observer.
Practice makes perfect.
Practice makes the master.
At 9 things started to get lively.
For heaven's sake!
Good heavens!
For heaven's sake!
In order to kill time I'll read a book.
To put it bluntly ...
To cut a long story short ...
Please give this your immediate attention.
What's it all about?
Just give me the broad outlines!
What about me?
I'll do it all the same!
Well then?
And now, by way of contrast
And how!
Don't I know it!
Lo and behold!
And what more do you want?
No matter what you say.
And they all lived happily ever after.
Nothing is so hard as man's ingratitude.
Bad weeds grow tall.
We could think of nothing to say.
Our conversation ran dry.
Our hotel runs a bus service.
Our stock is running short.
There was no let-up in our work.
Our expectations were pitched too high.
Our resources are spread very thin.
We must put off our plans.
Our plans have been upset.
Our products meet with a ready market.
Our production cannot cope with the demand.
We are working to a very tight schedule.
We are running out of supplies.
We are running out of supplies.
Our supplies are running low.
Rats!
One shows what he is made of under difficult conditions.
Don't interrupt me!
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare!
Things always seem to happen when you least expect them.
Delete as applicable.
Shall we leave it at that, then?
Doggone
Damnation!
Damn it!
Blast it!
Damn
Blimey!
Bloody hell!
Confound it!
Darn it!
It's easier to forgive than forget.
Forget it!
Scrap it!
Bear in mind that you've an appointment.
Don't lose courage!
Fuck off!
Don't fail to go there.
Time wasted is time lost.
Get along with you!
Put yourself in my place!
Don't get me wrong.
Can't you take a joke?
Do you take me?
Please get me right ...
Do you understand what I mean?
Do you see the point?
Let's have a go at it.
Have a go at it!
Just go and try it!
Don't you trust me?
Pardon me!
Sorry!
Sorry, I didn't quite understand.
Do without it!
Good luck!
Good luck!
The more danger, the more honor.
Have fun!
Have a good time!
Many hands make light work.
Many hounds soon catch the hare.
That isn't the only way of doing it
There isn't just one way of doing it.
There are more ways of killing a dog than by hanging.
Many kiss the hand they wish to cut off.
Many thanks!
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Thanks for calling!
There is much to be said for
It's sink or swim.
Fire in the hole!
A single stroke won't fell an oak.
One can take a leaf out of his book.
From now on it's all plain sailing.
For all I care.
Nothing can be created out of nothing.
You can't make something out of nothing.
Who originated the idea, by the way?
Shake well before using.
Stir before using.
Store away from heat!
Keep dry!
Given all I have said ...
Cattle crossing!
Mind the step!
Glass! Handle with care!
Watch your step!
Stand clear, the train is about to leave!
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
I dare say you're right.
Walls have ears.
When does the train reach London?
How long will it take you to recover?
Were you a party to this?
Have you ever been to Dresden?
Would you be kind enough to ...
Wait until I come.
Just wait!
Wait your turn!
Why not?
Why should I take the blame?
What does this mean?
What does this word mean?
What's the meaning of this word?
How much do I owe you?
What's the score?
A tree must be bent while it is young.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
You don't say so!
You don't say!
What next?
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
There's no time like the present.
Procrastination is the thief of time.
A stitch in time saves nine.
You've got something there!
What's the rush?
What's the big idea? Are you crazy?
What's up
How did you find it?
What considerations?
What nonsens!
What nonsense!
What a pantomime!
What a beauty!
What a surprise!
What cheek!
What sense!
What's that to me?
What's up?
What makes him tick?
What's new?
What's the news?
What's on your mind?
How does it strike you?
What do you make of it?
What does the weather look like to you?
How do you feel about this?
What have you been up to?
What have you done?
What does this portend?
What's it all about?
What induced you to do that?
Whatever I might do ...
Come to think of it ...
What has become of it?
What's this?
What racket are you in?
What's the matter now?
What's the occasion?
What's the consensus?
What are the plans for today?
What's on the agenda today?
What's your opinion?
What has come over you?
What's wrong with you?
What's the matter?
What's on in Berlin?
What's the pitch?
What's the trouble?
What's up?
What's the matter with you?
What's up with her?
What's gotten into you?
What of it!
What remains to be done?
How much does it cost?
What's the fare?
What's your main job?
what's the difference!
What's the odds?
What may he have imagined?
Those who can't use their head must use their back.
You've made your bed, now you must lie in it.
We believe what we wish to believe.
What is your opinion?
Your day may come.
What next?
I wonder what the reason may be.
What's the use anyhow?
Of what avail is it?
When it comes to looks ...
There's some sense in what she says.
What's to be done with it?
What's the point of that?
What does that mean?
How now?
What is the point of that?
What is that supposed to achieve?
What's the meaning of this?
What's it going to cost?
What's all this good for?
What would you like?
What would you like?
What next?
What's behind all this?
What's on the schedule for today?
What's on tonight?
What was that noise?
What do you expect to achieve by that?
Whatever do you want?
What do you prophesy will happen?
What do you mean by this?
What the heck do you mean?
What do you mean by this?
Hence with it!
Closed for annual holidays.
Don't you dare!
Fuck knows!
White mates in two.
On with the show!
Further occurrences must be avoided.
Keep moving!
What a coincidence!
What a contrast!
How sad a fate!
What colour is it?
What size do you take?
Which doctor attended you?
You are telling me!
What's the use anyhow!
Whom should I meet but ...
Who cares?

Who's the brain behind?
What is he accused of?
How?
However you do it.
Please yourself!
How old are you?
What's his age?
As can be seen from ...
The survey shows that ...
I beg your pardon?
Pardon?
however that may be
Like mother, like daughter.
Tit for tat.
All the same she came.
How do you like that?
How do you like this book?
How are things?
How are you?
How do you do?
How are you? I'm well, and you?

What is the weather like?
What relation is she to you?
What made him do that?
How on earth did he get here?
How can one be so touchy?
How can you do such a thing to me?
How do I get there?
How dare you?
How dare you say that?
How long does the journey take?
As the phrase goes ...
How kind of you!
How do you say ... in German / English?
What a pity!
What a shame!
How does one write ... ?
What an object you're!
What a sight you are.
What's the score on ...?
How did you hit on that?
How could he be expected to know that?
How can one be serious in such a case?

We all are apt to forget that ...
A prompt answer
We made him talk.
We are launching a new product.
We're getting nowhere fast.
We have reason to doubt it.
We've got our hands full.
We have our hands full with him.
We have been informed by ... that ...
We have been informed by ... that you are manufacturers of ...
We rented the house on a lease.
We've given notice that we're moving out of the flat.
We've done it!
It happened right in front of our eyes.
We cast
We've got some good news.
We haven't heard a peep from him.
We are currently experiencing problems with ...
We left no stone unturned.
We've got them on the run.
We've spent hours in discussion.
We've had a tough time.
The subject of ... came up.
Unfortunately, we can't produce the money for it just like that.
We can deduce therefore, that ...
We shall not know
We will follow in a couple of minutes.
We're not making any headway.
We're not getting any place.
We're constantly living beyond our means.
We'll pool expenses and travel together.
We made off.
We have to go as well.
We have to fight it out.
We have to tighten our belts now.
We must make tracks
We must live within our means.
We must live from hand to mouth.
We must stick together.
We happened to see it.
We slept out of doors.
We made it up.
We are frantic.
...
We look forward to hearing from you and remain ...
We are much obliged to you for this.
We are market leaders in ...
We are near relatives.
We have been instructed to ...
We don't always agree.
We play for love.
We're already up to our ears in debt.
Introducing ourselves ...
We met at night.
We had an unscheduled meeting.
We're only pretending.
We make assiduous efforts.
We have been given your address by ...
We wandered over hill and dale.
We would be able to ...
We can cope with that.
We will see that the necessary steps are taken.
We'll work it out somehow.
We'll win through in the end.
We are troubled with midges just now.
We aim to please.
Let's face the facts.
Let's leave it at that.
We were laid off.
We drew lots.
Will do!
Do you know your way around here?
Who do you think you're talking to?
What's bothering you?
What's on your mind?

Quite true but ...
Will you kindly hold your tongue!

Why is that?
What's he driving at?

Would you like anything else?
Could you go and get the paper?
Will you do me a favor?
I wonder if you would tell me ...
Would you be so kind and ...
Please be good enough to tell me ...
Show it to me, will you?

To my horror I noticed that...
To my dismay I discovered that...

Too many cooks spoil the broth.
On what terms?
Barely enough to keep body and soul together.
Confound it!
He concluded by saying ...
Cheers!
To your health!
At present I have a different occupation.
To sum up, I can say that ...
No admission for minors!
Staff only!
It is a long time ago, to be sure ...
